# Alfie Flutter

Context: Master's thesis, project at Mindera: Alfie — a Flutter eCommerce boilerplate application.

## Branching strategy

- /task — Task implementation (feature tickets)
- /bug — Bug fixes
- /chore — Configuration and CI/CD setup
- /release — Distribution / releases
- /hotfix — Hotfixes for releases

Notes: /task, /bug and /chore always merge into /main
